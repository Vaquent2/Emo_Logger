the most common error is module so if your having that error you can do a couple options:
1. Install the dependencies
2. Run modulefix.bat AS ADMINISTRATOR (It increases virtual memory if you want to check the code)-Note: restart after this one
3. Make sure to run the setup.bat
4. Downgrade to version Nightlight v.1.0
